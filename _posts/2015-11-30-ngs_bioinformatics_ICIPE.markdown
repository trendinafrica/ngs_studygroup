title: Bioinformatics approaches for Next Generation Sequencing analysis
text: The workshop will be run over the course of six days. The morning lectures will cover the theory of experimental design, different sequencing datasets and how to deal with them, and a range of applications of NGS technology including RNA-seq, methylome analysis, GWAS and rare variant calling. The afternoon programming practicals will focus on building up the students’ skills in using R and Unix to undertake bioinformatics analysis, including data processing and visualisation, as well as programming best practices such as testing and version control. The students will also work in small groups with each of the instructors to undertake a specialised project and get hands on analysis time, and the course will also include a scientific communication component. Throughout the course there will be a strong emphasis on the usage of open source technologies and an active “Do it yourself” spirit will be encouraged.
